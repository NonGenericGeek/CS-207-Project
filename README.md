# CS 207 Project: The Convenient Arduino Remote Device Built Ostensibly to Assert Robotic Dominance - Battle-Oriented Experiment (CARDBOARD-BOX) [version 0.02]
====================

This repository will contain the necessary information to build a (generally) scalable remote control drone vehicle. This vehicle will resemble an armoured mobile weapons platform, namely a tank.

Repository Contents
==========
* /build - Contains complete software, ready for use.
* /hardware - Contains nothing, at the moment.
* /img - contains images for this file.
* /src - Currently empty.
* /LICENSE-  The license for this project.
* /README.md - This file.

Materials
==========
Currently uncertain.
* A breadboard, probably
* Probably at least one Arduino
* A material sturdy enough to make a frame
* Some motors
* A slip ring
* Some wheels
* Some tracks to put on the wheels

Build Instructions	
==========
To help with scaling the project up, down, crosswise, or longitudinally, I have added a C++ program in /Build/Track_Length_calculator, along with its source code. Use it to calculate the length of track you will need for your frame.
IMPORTANT: be sure to measure the distances between the axles of your frame for the calculator. Doing otherwise will give you incorrect results.
Refer to the following image for what to measure.

Step one: Please wait for further build instructions.

Use
=====
Once complete, the drone will be controllable from a remote control. I will add an actual control scheme when I have one. I may have to do some math.
