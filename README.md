# CS 207 Project: The Convenient Arduino Remote Device Built Ostensibly to Assert Robotic Dominance - Battle-Oriented Experiment (CARDBOARD-BOX)
====================

This repository will contain the necessary information to build a (generally) scalable remote control drone vehicle. This vehicle will resemble an armoured mobile weapons platform, namely a tank.

Repository Contents
==========
* Pretty much nothing yet. Sorry.

Materials
==========
Currently uncertain.
* A breadboard, probably
* Probably at least one Arduino
* A material sturdy enough to make a frame
* Some motors
* A gearbox?
* Some wheels
* Some tracks to put on the wheels

Build Instructions	
==========
I will, if I can, include a small C++ program here, to help with scaling the project up, down, crosswise, or longitudinally. This is because the schematics will, if I do what I want to do with them, contain algebraic notation.

Step one: Please wait for further build instructions.

Use
=====
Once complete, the drone will be controllable from a remote control. I will add an actual control scheme when I have one. I may have to do some math.
